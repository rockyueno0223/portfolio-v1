# Midterm Project - Personal Portfolio Website

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a personal portfolio website that will be used to showcase your work and skills to potential employers. This website will be a living document that you can update throughout the program and beyond.

## Requirements

- Before you start building it, create a wireframe of your website. You can use Whimsical to create it and add a screenshot to your repository.
- Your website can have the following sections/pages:

  - Home
  - About
  - Projects
  - Skills (Soft and Hard Skills)
  - Work Experiences
  - Contact

- You can choose to have a separate page for each section or you can have a single page with multiple sections.
- You can use JavaScript if you want to. You are free to use different libraries or frameworks.

## Example Workflow

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Create a new branch with a descriptive name of your first implementation. You can also create different branches per page.
- Commit often and write descriptive commit messages.
- Once you are done with your first implementation, push your branch to GitHub and create a pull request.
- Once your pull request is approved, merge your branch into the main branch.
- Create a new branch for your second implementation or page and repeat the process.
- Do not work on the MAIN branch!

## Content

- Add a short bio about yourself.
- Add some images to your website. It can be a picture of yourself or any other image that you like. Screenshots of your projects are also a good idea.
- If you don't have a project yet, you can include this portfolio as your first one.

## Tools

- Visual Studio Code
- Whimsical (for wireframe)
